This release contains only one small feature, but it is a minor version bump instead of a patch version
because the previous version bump was incorrect - in 0.2.1 shapeless dependency was updated, which is binary
incompatible with its previous versions.

* Added support for serializing value classes, that is, those extending `AnyVal`, as regular values. While this
  was absolutely possible to do manually in previous versions of picopickle, this release introduces tools to make
  it automatic. You can find more in the [readme](value-classes).
* Updated Scala version to 2.11.8.
